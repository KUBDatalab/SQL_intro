No previous experience with SQL is assumed in this course. 

## Software requirements

However, in preparation for it, we do require you to have downloaded and
installed the database manager we are working with:

[DB Browser for SQLite](http://sqlitebrowser.org/) can be downloaded here.
It is available for Windows, Mac and Linux.

### Download the data

We are going to work with three datasets. Please download them to a place on
your computer, where you can find them again:

[imdb.zip](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KUBDatalab/SQL_intro/main/gh-pages/imdb.zip)

[netflix.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KUBDatalab/SQL_intro/gh-pages/data/netflix.csv)

[Murder mystery](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/KUBDatalab/SQL_intro/gh-pages/data/murder.zip)
