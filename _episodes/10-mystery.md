There has been a murder i SQL City. Let us try to solve it!

We have a database 

[INSTRUCTIONS ON HOW TO LOAD IT]

As an alternative, go to the website of the creators of this mystery:

https://mystery.knightlab.com/

Where you can solve it online.

## The only hint

A crime has taken place in SQL city, all the informatino you need is collected in
a database. Unfortunately, the only thing you remember is, that the crime 
took place on january 15th 2018, in SQL City. Begin by retrieving the crime
scene report from the database.

## Database structure

Until now we have only had two tables in our database.

With more complicated databases, as this one, a useful tool i an ER-digram:

## Have you found the solution?

Run this code:
INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, 'Insert the name of the person you found here');
      
        SELECT value FROM solution;
